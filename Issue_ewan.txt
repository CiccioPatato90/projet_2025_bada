here is the data for each aircraft :
To load your own BADA models, when instantiating an aircraft, pass as filePath the parent folder containing the desired BADA models. For example:

E.g. If your /home/<USER>/bada-models/BADA4/4.3/ folder contains:

A320-212
.
├── A320-212.ATF
├── A320-212_final_.mat
├── A320-212_ISA+20.PTD
├── A320-212_ISA+20.PTF
├── A320-212_ISA.PTD
├── A320-212_ISA.PTF
├── A320-212.xml
├── ECON.OPT
├── LRC.OPT
├── MEC.OPT
├── MRC.OPT
└── OPTALT.OPT
A320-232
.
├── A320-232.ATF
├── A320-232_final_.mat
├── A320-232_ISA+20.PTD
├── A320-232_ISA+20.PTF
├── A320-232_ISA.PTD
├── A320-232_ISA.PTF
├── A320-232.xml
├── ECON.OPT
├── LRC.OPT
├── MEC.OPT
├── MRC.OPT
└── OPTALT.OPT

NOTE: There are also XML files:
if the objective is to find the coefficients that they have stored in here, alors we would use an xml parser or a table generator and try to generate the desired format
by hand. At the end of the day, .PTD files are just text files with a different extensions.
What I've found was that without giving the filePath, the DUMMY aircrafts are embedded in the library.
For the Dummy-TWIN airplane we have been piped into txt file in the project directory.
Apart from this, I'd say that

You can instantiate an A320-232 like this:

AC = Bada4Aircraft(
    badaVersion=badaVersion,
    acName="A320-232",
    filePath="/home/<USER>/bada-models/BADA4/4.3",
)


but what the fuck are all the .ATF .OPT ? the data on our plane should be in that form if we want to compute it ... is there a way to transforma data into this form ?
there is some data conversion her : https://eurocontrol.github.io/pybada/API_reference/conversions.html#module-pyBADA.conversions


Possible API headers we might use include --> FT() flight trajectory, that allows us to control declaratively the various steps
that our plane undergoes. Everytime we want to change something we append a new "step" to the flightTrajectory object
by specifying the next target parameters.

Another is --> pyBADA.TCL.constantSpeedLevel() that calculates the time, fuel consumption,
and other parameters for a level flight segment at a constant speed for a given aircraft in the BADA model.
It supports step-climb, constant heading (true or magnetic), and turns.
